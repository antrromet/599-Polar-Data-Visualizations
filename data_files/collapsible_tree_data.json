Title\n\n\nDefining the domain of operation as part of a cell_method definition.\n\n\n2. Moderator\n\n\nsee comments\n\n\n3. Requirement\n\n\nThe information contained within a data variable's coordinate may have value in defining a cell_method for a result data variable calculated from the initial data variable.\n\n\n4. Initial Statement of Technical Proposal\n\n\n\u200b7.3.2 conventions reference\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2. Recording the spacing of the original data and other information\n\n\n\n\nTo indicate more precisely how the cell method was applied, extra information may be included in parentheses () after the identification of the method. This information includes standardized and non-standardized parts. Currently the only standardized information is The interval spacing keyword is used to provide the typical interval between the original data values to which the method was applied, in the situation where the present data values are statistically representative of original data values which had a finer spacing. The syntax is (interval: value unit), where value is a numerical value and unit is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package [UDUNITS].  The unit will usually be dimensionally equivalent to the unit of the corresponding dimension, but this is not required (which allows, for example, the interval for a standard deviation calculated from points evenly spaced in distance along a parallel to be reported in units of length even if the zonal coordinate of the cells is given in degrees). Recording the original interval is particularly important for standard deviations. For example, the standard deviation of daily values could be indicated by cell_methods=\"time: standard_deviation (interval: 1 day)\" and of annual values by cell_methods=\"time: standard_deviation (interval: 1 year)\".\n\n\n\n\nIf the cell method applies to a combination of axes, they may have a common original interval e.g. cell_methods=\"lat: lon: standard_deviation (interval: 10 km)\". Alternatively, they may have separate intervals, which are matched to the names of axes by position e.g. cell_methods=\"lat: lon: standard_deviation (interval: 0.1 degree_N interval: 0.2 degree_E)\", in which 0.1 degree applies to latitude and 0.2 degree to longitude.\n\n\n\n\nTo explicitly define the domain over which the statistic was calculated, the syntax (domain: varname [varname]) may be used.  In this case, each 'varname' listed is the name of an ancillary variable, explicitly referenced by the data variable.  Each of the ancillary variables referenced contributes to the definition of the domain over which the cell_method operation was conducted.\n\n\n5. Benefits\n\n\nThe community will benefit by having enhanced capabilities for defining cell_methods for data variables calculated across complex domains.\n\n\n\n\n\u200bhttps://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/trac/wiki/aggregateExampleMH presents a use case for this capability.\n\n\n6.

Within the marine environment there are at least half a million taxa.  However, CF isn't confined to the marine environment and so the number runs into millions, even billions.  When a variable in CF describes a property of a taxon, such as its numeric concentration or abundance one approach would be to incorporate the taxon name into the Standard Name.  However, experience with other parameter vocabularies has shown that this can quickly become unsustainable.\nConsequently, taxonomic names are handled in a similar manner to geographic names using a generic Standard Name for the data variable plus co-ordinate variables to carry the label text. The data variable is labelled using Standard Names of the form 'property_of_taxon_in_medium'.  For example, taxon abundance in a water body would be described by the Standard Name 'number_concentration_of_taxon_in_sea_water'.\nThe labelling co-ordinate variables have the Standard Names 'taxon_name' and 'taxon_identifier'. The taxon name included in the data must be taken from a recognised source.  Currently, these are the World Register of Marine Species or WoRMS (\u200bhttp://www.marinespecies.org/), which is the preferred resource for the marine environment or the International Taxonomic Information System or ITIS (\u200bhttp://www.itis.gov/) for terrestrial flora and fauna.  Note that the only requirement for CF is that the name used is registered in at least one of the named resources.  It does not have to be designated as 'valid'.\nThe taxon_identifier from either WoRMS (the aphia ID) or ITIS (the taxonomic serial number or TSN) need to include namespace strings, which are 'aphia:' or 'tsn:'.  For example, Calanus finmarchicus is encoded as either 'aphia:104464' or 'tsn:85272'. For the marine domain WoRMS has more complete coverage and so aphia Ids are preferred.\nExample 6.3\nThis example shows how the taxonomic information would be encoded for a simple time series of abundance for two taxa.  For clarity, a lot of information - such as the time variable has been omitted.\ndimensions;\n\n\n\ntime=1000;\nstring80=80;\ntaxon=2;\n\n\n\nvariables:\n\n\n\nfloat abundance(time,taxon);\n\n\n\nabundance:standard_name=&#34;number_concentration_of_taxon_in_sea_water\";\nabundance:coordinates=&#34;taxon_identifier taxon_name\";\n\n\n\nchar taxon_name(taxon,string80);\n\n\n\ntaxon_name:standard_name=&#34;taxon_name\";\n\n\n\nchar taxon_identifier(taxon,string80);\n\n\n\ntaxon_name:standard_name=&#34;taxon_identifier\";\n\n\n\n\ndata;\ntaxon_name = \"Calanus finmarchicus\", \"Calanus helgolandicus\"\ntaxon_label = \"aphia:104464\", \"aphia:104466\"\n\nConsequences for Standard Names\n\nThe following new Standard Names are required to describe the label variables and to support the bacterial data request that inspired the creation of this ticket. One more has been included in support of the above example.\ntaxon_name\nThe human-readable label for the taxon such as Calanus finmarchicus.  The label should be registered in either WoRMS or ITIS and spelled exactly as registered.\ntaxon_identifier\nThe machine-readable identifier for the taxon registration in either WoRMS (the aphia ID) or ITIS (the taxonomic serial number or TSN), including namespace.  The namespace strings are 'aphia:' or 'tsn:'.  For example, Calanus finmarchicus is encoded as either 'aphia:104464' or 'tsn:85272'. For the marine domain WoRMS has more complete coverage and so aphia Ids are preferred.\ncolony_forming_unit_number_concentration_of_taxon_in_sea_water\n\"Colony Forming Unit\" means an estimate of the viable bacterial or fungal numbers determined by counting colonies grown from a sample.  \"Number concentration\" means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. \"Taxon\" means an organism named in the taxon_name and taxon_identifier variables.\nnumber_concentration_of_taxon_in_sea_water\n\"Number concentration\" means the number of particles or other specified objects per unit volume. \"Taxon\" means an organism named in the taxon_name and taxon_identifier variables."]}]}, {"name": "Calit2 : California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology", "children": [{"name": ["The Events RSS feed keeps track of the latest seminars, conferences and other meetings posted on the Calit2 website.

This would involve:\n\n'x_' type standard names being valid for all coordinate definitions:\n'\"x\" indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x.'\n'eastward_' type standard names being valid for all 'true east' vectors:\n'\"Eastward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward); where eastward is defined as the grid x-axis direction, this is a constrained version of the \"x_\" standard name';\nthis may be interpreted in two ways, as:\nwhere eastward is defined as the grid x-axis, this standard name is a constrained version of x_wind\nwhere eastward is not defined as the grid x-axis, this standard name stands independently\n\nThis enables data producers to use eastward wind in the same way they currently do, while meeting my requirements, for datasets where x may or may not be east, depending on the location and for data format interoperability with formats which do not have an explicit 'eastward_' phenomenon definition.\n\n\nIt enables datasets to be written where:\n\nvector is x but not east\nstandard_name: x_&lt;&gt;\nvector is x and may be east or eastish\nstandard_name: x_&lt;&gt;\nvector is x and happens to be always east\nstandard_name: x_&lt;&gt;\nvector is x constrained to always be east\nstandard_name: eastward_&lt;&gt;\nvector is east but not x\nstandard_name: eastward_&lt;&gt;\n\n'eastward_&lt;&gt;' is already interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the coordinate variable context of the dataset.  'x_&lt;&gt;' should also be abe to be interpreted based on coordinate variable context, to enable datasets to be encoded which currently cannot be written in a CF compliant fashion\n\nAnalogy\n\nThis approach, of constraining standard names, is analogous to qualification.  For example:\n\nthere is a standard name of air_pressure\nthis could be defined, for a particular dataset, such that the vertical coordinate indicates that the data is at a surface\nif the fact that the dataset is at a surface is intrinsic to the data, the qualified (constrained) standard name may be used: surface_air_pressure"]}]}, {"name": "Joe Ovies", "children": [{"name": ["Joe Ovies is the co-host of the afternoon and evening sports talk show on 99.9 FM The Fan ESPN Radio."]}]}, {"name": "East Asian Languages & Cultural Studies, UC Santa Barbara", "children": [{"name": ["UC Santa Barbara, Humanities & Fine Arts Division"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: LCROSS Captured in Flight by Amateur Astronomer", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: ISS Daily Summary Report \u2013 01/26/15", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "NASA's Visible Earth - Category\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0Landsat 3", "children": [{"name": ["RSS data feed for NASA's Visible Earth Website"]}]}, {"name": "International Research Institute for Climate and Society \u00bb Projects", "children": []}, {"name": "ESA Observing the Earth", "children": [{"name": ["ESA Observing the Earth"]}]}, {"name": "LATEST GHRC NEWS", "children": []}, {"name": "UCSF Student Life", "children": [{"name": ["Student Life responsible for a range of student services, programs and resources at UCSF.

However, in section 9.2 there is a seemingly contradictory statement \"If there is only a single feature to be stored in a data variable, there is no need for an instance dimension and it is permitted to omit it.\" -- I propose to clearly label the optional indices as optional in table 9.1 and describe features versus collections before Table 9.1 (i.e. interchange sections 9.1 and 9.2 with potential minor rewriting).\nWould it make sense to specify the maximum allowed dimensions or is this too restrictive? As far as I can see there may be a small set for each feature type and it could thus be helpful to have these listed explicitly rather than stating that extra dimensions can be added at will.\n\n2) Collection of feature types from CF, THREDDS, and INSPIRE:\n\n\nNote that definitions of terms further down are often incomplete.\n\nRectifiedGridCoverage?: coverage whose domain consists of a rectified grid \u2013 a grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of a coordinate reference system. Basically, this means that the 2-dimensional grid can be described by two 1-dimensional vectors (examples: longitude and latitude or UTM easting and UTM northing). The grid can have additional dimensions such as a vertical dimension z or an ensemble coordinate e. Thus the representation is data(m, i, j, k, o) e(m) x(i) y(j) z(k)  t(o) with m, k, o optional.\nReferenceableGridCoverage?: coverage whose domain consists of a referenceable grid \u2013 a grid associated with a transformation that can be used to convert grid coordinate values to values of coordinates referenced to a coordinate reference system. Thus the representation is data(m, i, k, o) e(m) x(i) y(i) z(k)  t(o) with m, k, o optional.\nPoint: one or more parameters measured at a set of points in time and space (having no implied coordinate relationship to other points). Thus the representation is data(i) x(i) y(i) t(i) with i optional.\n\n\nTimeSeries?: a time-series of data points at the same location, with varying time. A series of data points at the same spatial location with monotonically increasing times. Thus the representation is data(i, o) x(i) y(i) t(i, o) with i optional.\nTrajectory: A series of data points along a path through space with monotonically increasing times (example: backtrajectory model calculation; aircraft flight path). Thus the representation is data(i, o) x(i, o) y(i, o) z(i, o) t(i, o) with i, z optional.\nProfile: an ordered set of data points along a vertical line at a fixed horizontal position and fixed time (example: one balloon sounding or aircraft takeoff or landing). Thus the representation is data(i, k) x(i) y(i) z(i, k) t(i) with i optional.\nTimeSeriesProfile?: a series of profile features at the same horizontal position with monotonically increasing times  (example: balloon soundings from a station). Thus the representation is data(i, k, o) x(i) y(i) z(i, k, o) t(i, o) with i optional.\nTrajectoryProfile?: a series of profile features located at points ordered along a trajectory (example: aircraft lidar profiles). Thus the representation is data(i, k, o) x(i, o) y(i, o) z(i, k, o) t(i, o) with i optional.\nForecastModelRunCollection?:  a  collection of forecast model runs, which can be uniquely identified by the start of the model run, called the model run time, also called the analysis time or generating time. Each model run has a series of forecast times. A collection of these runs therefore has two time coordinates, the run time and the forecast time. An FMRC creates a 2D ctime collection dataset, and then creates various 1D time subsets out of it.\n       Image: Image data which may consist of several layers or channels. Thus the representation is data(i, j, h)  c(h) with h optional. (?? Need optional geo-rectification of images, time series of images etc. ??)\nRADIAL: Radial data\nSECTION: Section data\nSTATION: Station data (alias for TimeSeries?) -- should aliases be allowed?\nSTATION_PROFILE: Stations of profiles (alias for TimeSeriesProfile?)  -- should aliases be allowed?\nSWATH: Swath Data\nANY: No specific type (??

Title\n\nTwo new dimensionless vertical coordinates to support ocean models\n\n2. Moderator\n\nRich Signell\n\n3. Requirement\n\nThe ocean modeling community needs two additional vertical coordinate specifications to allow modern s-coordinate model output to be CF-compliant and allow more general specification of  s-coordinate model output for future development.\n\n4. Initial Statement of Technical Proposal\n\nThe existing ocean_s_coordinate dimensionless vertical coordinate specification in CF is limited to a specific vertical stretching function and set of control parameters, while modern versions of ROMS allow for more flexible specification.  Additional of these two new generalized vertical coordinate specifications would allow output from existing ROMS-derived models (and other s coordinate models) to be CF-compliant, as well as allowing more flexibility for future s_coordinate model developers and users to write and read CF-compliant model output.\n\n\nHere are the proposed additions to Appendix D.  Dimensionless Vertical Coordinates\n\n\nOcean s-coordinate, generic form 1\n\n   standard_name = \"ocean_s_coordinate_g1\"\n\n\nDefinition:\n\n   z(n,k,j,i) = S(k,j,i) + eta(n,j,i) * (1 + S(k,j,i) / depth(j,i))\n    where S(k,j,i) = depth_c * s(k) + (depth(j,i) - depth_c) * C(k)\n\n\nand where z(n,k,j,i) is the height, positive upwards, relative to\nocean datum (e.g. mean sea level) at gridpoint (n,k,j,i);\neta(n,j,i) is the height of the ocean surface, positive upwards,\nrelative to ocean datum at gridpoint (n,j,i); s(k) is the\ndimensionless coordinate at vertical gridpoint (k) with a\nrange of -1 &lt;= s(k) &lt;= 0, s(0) corresponds to eta(n,j,i) whereas\ns(-1) corresponds to depth(j,i); C(k) is the dimensionless vertical\ncoordinate stretching function at gridpoint (k) with a range of\n-1 &lt;= C(k) &lt;= 0, C(0) corresponds to eta(n,j,i) whereas\nC(-1) corresponds to depth(j,i); and the constant depth_c,\n(positive value), is a critical depth controlling the stretching.\n\n\nThe format for the formula_terms attribute is\n\nformula_terms = \"s: var1 C: var2 eta: var3 depth: var4 depth_c: var5\"\n\nOcean s-coordinate, generic form 2\n\n   standard_name = \"ocean_s_coordinate_g2\"\n\n\nDefinition:\n\n   z(n,k,j,i) = eta(n,j,i) + (eta(n,j,i) + depth(j,i)) * S(k,j,i)\n    where S(k,j,i) = (depth_c * s(k) + depth(j,i) * C(k)) / (depth_c + depth(j,i))\n\n\nand where z(n,k,j,i) is the height, positive upwards, relative to\nocean datum (e.g. mean sea level) at gridpoint (n,k,j,i);\neta(n,j,i) is the height of the ocean surface, positive upwards,\nrelative to ocean datum at gridpoint (n,j,i); s(k) is the\ndimensionless coordinate at vertical gridpoint (k) with a\nrange of -1 &lt;= s(k) &lt;= 0, s(0) corresponds to eta(n,j,i) whereas\ns(-1) corresponds to depth(j,i); C(k) is the dimensionless vertical\ncoordinate stretching function at gridpoint (k) with a range of\n-1 &lt;= C(k) &lt;= 0, C(0) corresponds to eta(n,j,i) whereas\nC(-1) correspond to depth(j,i); and the constant depth_c,\n(positive value) is a critical depth controlling the stretching.\n\n\nThe format for the formula_terms attribute is\n\nformula_terms = \"s: var1 C: var2 eta: var3 depth: var4 depth_c: var5\"\n5. Benefits\n\n\nThe oceanographic community, especially those producing or consuming products from s coordinate models (e.g. variants and derivatives of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)) would benefit from the addition of these two new dimensionless vertical coordinate specifications.   These two new coordinates have been exercised in the Unidata Common Data Model and the Unidata NetCDF-Java Library for the last two years.   It's time to add them officially to the CF Conventions.\n\n\n6. Status Quo\n\n\nThe only option currently to store modern ROMS results as CF compliant would be to write the entire Z field as a 4D array."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: What are you looking at?", "children": [{"name": ["The news and information source for faculty and staff"]}]}, {"name": "Icelights: Your Burning Questions About Ice & Climate \u00bb Glaciers", "children": [{"name": ["Your Burning Questions About Ice & Climate"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: ISS Daily Summary Report \u2013 07/30/13", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: ISS Daily Summary Report \u2013 05/28/14", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Ames Stereo Pipeline 2.0 Released", "children": [{"name": ["Just another WordPress site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments for Whale SENSE", "children": [{"name": ["Promoting responsible whale watching"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Abundance of creative capital", "children": []}, {"name": "NOAA Climate.gov - Orbital Cycles", "children": []}, {"name": "NOAA Climate.gov - Deforestation", "children": []}, {"name": "Tag: MEaSUREs", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments on: Documentation", "children": [{"name": ["Data Conservancy is devoted to developing institutional solutions for the challenges of data collection, preservation and re-use."]}]}, {"name": "UW-Madison News: Obituaries", "children": [{"name": ["News stories from the University of Wisconsin-Madison"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: About the AGU Fall Meeting", "children": [{"name": ["2014 AGU Fall Meeting"]}]}, {"name": "Observe Your World \u00bb MND", "children": [{"name": ["NASA Science for YOU"]}]}, {"name": "Reflect.

Structured metadata expressed through languages of description make it possible for us to 'speak' about the contents of our treasure troves. But, like all human languages, our languages of description both enable and isolate. The push to break out of the isolation of the metadata silos in which professionals inevitably design, implement and manage metadata in order to discover the intersections of our treasure troves drives much of today's discourse and emerging practice in metadata. The emergence of massively integrated Web presences such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) along with the reshaping of public access globally through mechanisms such as Linked Data and schema.org drive our conversations, our excitement, and our fears. Every year the DCMI community gathers for both its Annual Meeting and its International Conference on Dublin Core &amp; Metadata Applications. The work agenda of the DCMI community is broad and inclusive of all aspects of innovation in metadata design, implementation and best practices. While the work of the Initiative progresses throughout the year, the Annual Meeting &amp; Conference provides the opportunity for DCMI \"citizens\" as well as newcomers, students, apprentices, and early career professionals to gather face-to-face to share experiences. In addition, the gathering provides public- and private-sector initiatives beyond DCMI that are doing significant metadata work to come together to compare notes and cast a broader light into their particular metadata work silos. Through such a gathering of the metadata communities, DCMI advances its \"first goal\" of promoting metadata interoperability and harmonization. This year, the Annual Meeting &amp; Conference is being hosted by the Universidade Estadual Paulista\u2014S\u00e3o Paulo State University \u00bb and held in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.   Technical Program Deadlines Peer-Reviewed Papers, Project Reports &amp; Posters  Submission Deadline: 28 March 2015 Author Notification: 23 June 2015 Final Copy: 28 July 2015   Professional Program Deadlines Special &amp; Panel Sessions  Proposal Deadline: 28 March 2015 Author Notification: 25 April 2015  Best Practice Posters &amp; Demonstrations  Submission Deadline: 14 July 2015 Author Notification: Ongoing   The non-peer reviewed Best Practice Posters &amp; Demonstrations track provides professionals working on innovative solutions to metadata problems in their organizations with the opportunity to seek community feedback and guidance and to showcase their developments and outcomes. Submission are encouraged from metadata practitioners, researchers, and organizations including libraries, museums and archives. While the track is not peer reviewed, the posters and demonstration resources as well as their extended abstracts will be citable and become part of the conference's permanent record. Submission to the track are accepted through 14 July 2015. Submit now at http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2015/cfp. In collaboration with our host, \u00ab Universidade Estadual Paulista\u2014S\u00e3o Paulo State University \u00bb, DCMI will build on its successful program to support next generation professionals though active participation of graduate students studying to be practitioners and researchers as well as early career professionals in the Conference and Annual Meeting activities by having their schools and employing institutions sponsor their attendance. At the Conference, the next generation professionals will engage in 1-on-1 and group interactions with leading researchers, consultants, and practitioners shaping the metadata ecosystem and in a Special Session designed specifically for them where they will gain an understanding of how the discourse and practice of metadata is evolving and how today's innovations are changing for better metadata modeling, design, and implementation through a range of well-established and emerging best practices. Participating institutions sponsoring Next Generation Delegates will have their logos prominently showcased on the Conference website. In addition, the institutions will be listed and thanked as a sponsor in the opening session of the conference and in the Special Session devoted to the students and early career professionals. Leading up to the Conference, messages identifying sponsors will be posted to the DCMI social media channels. More information on how your institution can participate in supporting the Next Generation will be written here over the next several months.

Steve Hankin and I discussed this on the CF email list and further by email and phone.

For instance, if a depth of 1000 metres is represented by -1000 and positive is up, it would be inconsistent to give the standard_name as depth, whose definition (vertical distance below the surface) implies positive down. If an application detects such an inconsistency, the user should be warned, and the positive attribute should be used to determine the sign convention.\n\n\n\nInsert the following into Section 4.3 of the conformance document:\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\n\n\nThe positive attribute should be consistent with the sign convention implied by the definition of the standard_name, if both are provided.\n\n\n\nThere is no general way to check consistency at present.\n\n\nJonathan"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: NASA\u2019s Mars Rover Opportunity\u2019s distance traveled on Mars nears that of a Marathon Race", "children": [{"name": ["The voice of Clarksville Tennessee.

This is accomplished by associating these dimensions with the relevant set of latitude, longitude, vertical, time and any non-spatiotemporal coordinates.\n\n\n\nThese changes clarify that coordinate systems belong to data variables (rather than any other type of variable in a CF-netCDF file) and recognise the use of non-spatiotemporal dimensions.\n\n\nReplace this text in the second paragraph\n\n\n\nAll of a variable's dimensions that are latitude, longitude, vertical, or time dimensions (see Section 1.2, \"Terminology\") must have corresponding coordinate variables, i.e., one-dimensional variables with the same name as the dimension\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\nAny of a variable's dimensions that is an independently varying latitude, longitude, vertical, or time dimension (see Section 1.2, \"Terminology\") and that has a size greater than one must have a corresponding coordinate variable, i.e., a one-dimensional variable with the same name as the dimension\n\n\n\nThese changes remove the implication that spatiotemporal scalar coordinates might be prohibited, and allow for discrete axes (section 4.5, used extensively in section 9).\n\n\nReplace this text in the third paragraph\n\n\n\nAll of a variable's spatiotemporal dimensions that are not latitude, longitude, vertical, or time dimensions are required to be associated with the relevant latitude, longitude, vertical, or time coordinates via the new coordinates attribute of the variable\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\nAny longitude, latitude, vertical or time coordinate which depends on more than one spatiotemporal dimension must be identified by the coordinates attribute of the data variable.\n\n\n\nThis change is for clarity.\n\n\nReplace this text in the fifth paragraph\n\n\n\nThe use of coordinate variables is required whenever they are applicable. That is, auxiliary coordinate variables may not be used as the only way to identify latitude and longitude coordinates that could be identified using coordinate variables.\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\nIf the longitude, latitude, vertical or time coordinate is multi-valued and varies in only one dimension, it is not permitted to store it as an auxiliary coordinate variable.\n\n\n\nThis change is for simplicity and clarity. The use of coordinate variables where applicable is already required by the second paragraph.\n\n\nAppend to the fifth paragraph\n\n\n\nIf the longitude, latitude, vertical or time coordinate is single-valued, it may be stored either as a coordinate variable with a dimension of size one, or as a scalar coordinate variable (Section 5.7).\n\n\n\nThis change recognises the use of spatiotemporal scalar coordinates."]}]}, {"name": "First Monday", "children": [{"name": ["First Monday is one of the first openly accessible, peer\u2013reviewed journals on the Internet, solely devoted to the Internet.

(If this turns out to be a bad idea, we can just delete it). I will try to copy the relevant sections of the original proposal here, so the readers can focus on whats already been said.\n\n\nThe original proposal:\n\n\nThe common_concept should bundle together properties of a CF variable (e.g. the standard_name and specific cell_methods or scalar coordinate variable values) with a scoped name and a CF registered universal resource name (URN).\n\n\n(comment) This, along with the use cases below, imply that some modified version of CDL would be used essentially as a constraint language to express the semantics that the data variable should have. This discussion will try to focus on just the use of CDL as a way of expressing these semantics.\n\n\nUse Cases\n\nCommunities wish to define a common short form name (see ticket 11). For example, a GFDL modelling group might want to define high cloud. They would propose\n\nCommon Concept: {gfdl.noaa.gov}high_cloud\nDefined as:\n\ndimensions:\n    hgt=1;\nvariables:\n    float x(unconstrained);\n        x:standard_name:\"cloud_area_fraction\" ;\n        x:units=\"1\";\n        x:coordinates=\"height + unconstrained\";\n        x:common_concept:\"{gfdl.noaa.gov}high_cloud;tbd\";\n    float height (unconstrained);\n        height:units=\"m\";\n        height:valid_min=7000.;\n        height:valid_max=14000.;\n\nNote that in this case, the height variable may be geospatially varying or not, the common concept does not limit this aspect.\n\nA very similar example is Near Surface Temperature. Some parts of the world use 2m air temperature, some 6 foot air temperature and some work with 1.5 m. Near surface temperature is commonly understood to be a temperature from less than 10m.\n\nHere we want simply to associate a coordinate variable, but one with some restricted properties.\n\n\nCommon Concept: {badc.nerc.ac.uk}near_surface_air_temperature\nDefined as:\n\nvariables:\n    float tsurf(unconstrained) ;\n        tsurf:standard_name = \"air_temperature\" ;\n        tsurf:units = \"K\" ;\n        tsurf:coordinates = \"height + unconstrained\" ;\n        tsurf:common_concept =\n          \"{badc.nerc.ac.uk}near_surface_air_temperature; urn:cf-cc:blah123\" ;\n    float height;\n        height:units=\"m\";\n        height:valid_min=0.0;\n        height:valid_max=10.0;\n\nValid data files simply indicate which height they actually use, but are limited to one!\n\nThe IPCC AR5 wishes to declare a bunch of new common variables, including climate statistics such as frost days, tropical days. These are not easily amenable to introduction as standard names, yet they are frequently used concepts.\n\nWhile they could be introduced as standard names, with the addition of common concepts, one new standard name, and one new cell method, a wide range of these types of data can be included without difficulty.\n\n\nThe AMS glossary says: frost day: An observational day on which frost occurs; one of a family of climatic indicators (e.g., thunderstorm day, rain day).\nThe definition is somewhat arbitrary, depending upon the accepted criteria for a frost observation. Thus, it may be\n1) a day on which the minimum air temperature in the thermometer shelter falls below 0degC (32degF);\n2) a day on which a deposit of white frost is observed on the ground;\n3) in British usage, a day on which the minimum temperature at the level of the ground or on the tops of low, close-growing vegetation falls to -0.9degC (30.4degF) or below (also called a \"day with ground frost\"); and perhaps others. The present trend is to drop such terms in favor of something less ambiguous, such as \"day with minimum temperature below 0degC (32degF)\".\n\n\nPotentially these could be all introduced as standard names, but they all depend on two underlying factors: something we could characterise with a standard name of \"number_of_occurrences\", and something we can characterise as a cell_method_modifier of threshold crossing.\nIt would seem simpler and more scalable to introduce these new features, and use the common concepts, rather than proliferate standard names."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: What is the Earth\u2019s Radiation Budget?", "children": [{"name": ["Mentoring and inquirY using NASA Data on Atmospheric and earth science for Teachers and Amateurs"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Why a National Digital Stewardship Alliance Student Group?", "children": [{"name": ["The Signal: Digital Preservation"]}]}, {"name": "EPA Home", "children": [{"name": ["Updated EPA Home content from the US Environmental Protection Agency"]}]}, {"name": "UW-Madison News: Video", "children": [{"name": ["News stories from the University of Wisconsin-Madison"]}]}, {"name": "Brandkraft - Marketing, online.", "children": [{"name": ["Social Media Marketing, SEO, SMO, SEA"]}]}, {"name": "Watch the Skies \u00bb students", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "UC Health \u00bb Administration", "children": [{"name": ["University of California health news"]}]}, {"name": "E&ENews PM", "children": [{"name": ["Stay ahead of the headlines"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Raskin Scholarship", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments for AICCU", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments on: Books", "children": [{"name": ["AGU publishes highly respected, peer-reviewed scientific journals, a member newspaper, and award-winning books."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Tsunami safe?", "children": [{"name": ["A world of research at Oregon State University"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Sun-Earth Day 2013", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Watch the Skies \u00bb DAU", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Home", "children": []}, {"name": "Research Matters", "children": []}, {"name": "CHC Feed", "children": []}, {"name": "On the Line\u2014A NOAA Fisheries Podcast", "children": [{"name": ["On the Line is a NOAA Fisheries podcast about marine fish and wildlife and their ocean habitats, with stories told by the people who study, manage, and protect these valuable resources on behalf of the American public.

Since there can only be one coordinate variable for the dimension (the variable with the same name as the dimension), any alternative sets of values have to be stored in auxiliary coordinate variables. For such alternative coordinate variables, there are no mandatory attributes, but they may have any of the attributes allowed for coordinate variables.\"\n\n\nBut in paragraph 4 of Chapter 5 it states:\n\n\n\"The axis attribute is not allowed for auxiliary coordinate variables.\"\n\n\nin contradiction to the statement in section 6.2.\n\n\nFurthermore, according to the definition of a scalar coordinate variable (section 1.2), it is supposed to be \"functionally equivalent to either a size one coordinate variable or a size one auxiliary coordinate variable.\"  The only way for this to be possible is for both types of scalar coordinates to include the same attributes.  Currently the CF document forbids use of the axis attribute in conjunction with auxiliary coordinate variables, but allows its use for coordinate variables.  To make the two consistent, the following change to paragraph 4 of Chapter 5 is proposed:\n\n\nReplace \"The axis attribute is not allowed for auxiliary coordinate variables.  Auxiliary coordinate variables ...\" by \"If an axis attribute is attached to an auxiliary coordinate variable, it can be used by applications in the same way the axis attribute is used in conjunction with coordinate variables.  Note that if this attribute is missing, it may still be possible to determine if a particular dimension should be associated with the auxiliary coordinate variable.  For example, auxiliary coordinate variables ...\"\n\n\nNote that in Example 5.2, the axis attribute \"X\" is associated with xc, and if the above change were adopted, the axis attribute could also appear in conjunction with the auxiliary coordinate variable \"lon\".  Would this cause problems?\n\n\nAlso, some folks might misinterpret the paragraph at the end of section 2.4, which states that \"The advantage of using a coordinate variable is that all its attributes can be used to describe the single-valued quantity, including boundaries.\" to mean that this is an \"advantage over a a size one auxiliary coordinate variable\", when in fact it means an \"advantage over *omitting* the scalar variable\".  I therefore propose rewriting this sentence to read:\n\n\n\"The use of a scalar coordinate variable is encouraged, when appropriate, because the coordinate attributes (including axis attribute and the cell bounds) can be defined to more fully describe the quantity of interest.\""]}]}, {"name": "WCRP e-zine", "children": [{"name": ["The aims of WCRP  is to facilitate analysis and prediction of Earth System variability and change for use in an increasing range of practical applications of direct relevance, benefit and value to society"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: 264th Combat Communications Squadron soldier returns home from Liberia, Ebola free", "children": [{"name": ["The voice of Clarksville Tennessee.

A field construct (hereafter a field) is as defined\nin the proposed\n\u200bCF data model (see \u200bticket #68), as\nare all other terms written in bold.  In terms of CF-netCDF\nfiles, a field corresponds to a data variable, with all its\nattributes, coordinate variables, auxiliary coordinate variables, etc.\n\n\nAggregation may be thought of as the combination of one field with\nanother to create a new field that occupies a larger space. In\npractice, this means combining two fields so that their data\narrays are concatenated along exactly one dimension, as are their\ncoordinate arrays which span that dimension, in such a way that\nthe aggregated field conforms to the CF data model (and is therefore\nCF-netCDF compliant).\n\n\nThe CF-netCDF convention at present applies only to individual files,\nbut there is a common and increasing need to be able to treat a\ncollection files as a single dataset, and the CF standard does not\ndefine how this should be done.  Like the\n\u200bticket for the CF data model, this ticket does not propose any change to the CF\nstandard. Our purpose is to write down general abstract rules for CF\nfield aggregation which are consistent with the abstract CF data\nmodel.\n\n\nThese proposed CF aggregation rules make no reference to netCDF file\nformat. They are built solely on the abstract CF data model. As such,\nthey may be applied equally to fields stored in CF-netCDF files or to\nfields contained in a memory representation of the CF data model. To\nsupport the CF data model, we produced the \u200bcf-python software, and\nthe latest version of that software includes an aggregation function\nbased on these aggregation rules.  This function can be used to\ncombine CF-netCDF files by aggregating the fields they contain.\n\n\nOur proposed rules are more flexible than the existing schemes that we\nare aware of.  They are similar to the\n\u200bNcML aggregation types JoinExisting and JoinNew, but are more\ngeneral in various ways, such as that the aggregating dimension need\nnot be the outer dimension, nor be in the same position in different\nfields. Also, if combining fields from various netCDF files, the\nnetCDF variable names need not match, because the variables are\nidentified by their metadata instead of by their names. Any number of\nfields may ultimately be aggregated along more one or more dimensions\nby repeated aggregations between pairs of fields.  Our software can\nhandle this general approach, but it needs optimisation.\n\n\nThis proposal is closely related to the CF data model\n(\u200bticket #68), and we would\nwelcome comments on that ticket as well as the present one.\n\n\nDavid Hassell (d.c.hassell at reading.ac.uk)\n\nJonathan Gregory (j.m.gregory at reading.ac.uk)"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Engineering Design", "children": [{"name": ["Mentoring and inquirY using NASA Data on Atmospheric and earth science for Teachers and Amateurs"]}]}, {"name": "CF Metadata: Ticket #50: Upgrade CF Checker to use CDAT-5.x and udunits2", "children": [{"name": ["Upgrade CF Checker to work with CDAT-5.x and udunits2"]}]}, {"name": "Icelights: Your Burning Questions About Ice & Climate \u00bb Biology", "children": [{"name": ["Your Burning Questions About Ice & Climate"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Music at St. Paul\u2019s", "children": [{"name": ["Columbia University in the City of New York"]}]}, {"name": "Phys.org: Biotechnology News", "children": [{"name": ["Phys.org provides the latest news on biotechnology"]}]}, {"name": "NSIDC Data Announcements \u00bb satellite", "children": [{"name": ["News and Tips for NSIDC Data Users"]}]}, {"name": "Watch the Skies \u00bb Comet Elenin", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "The Alexander Group | Atmospheric Sciences | University of Washington", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments for Oral History in the Digital Age", "children": []}, {"name": "GlobalChange.gov News", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments on: The Large, the Small, and Statistical Significance", "children": [{"name": ["NASA scientists are in the field and write home to tell about it."]}]}, {"name": "Phys.org: Environment News", "children": [{"name": ["Phys.org provides the latest news on the environment, environmental issues, earth science and space exploration."]}]}, {"name": "CNI: Coalition for Networked Information", "children": [{"name": ["CNI: Coalition for Networked Information"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Housing", "children": [{"name": ["2014 AGU Fall Meeting"]}]}, {"name": "Gamasutra.com - All Blogs", "children": [{"name": ["Gamasutra Blogs"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Two Minutes Until SMAP Deploy", "children": []}, {"name": "Comments on: Multimedia", "children": []}, {"name": "Data Conservancy \u00bb Names", "children": [{"name": ["Data Conservancy is devoted to developing institutional solutions for the challenges of data collection, preservation and re-use."]}]}, {"name": "open.NASA \u00bb orbital perspective", "children": [{"name": ["a collaborative approach to open, direct, and transparent communication about your space agency"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Improving the readability of articles \u2013 version 25 is out", "children": [{"name": ["Organize, read and share what matters to you."]}]}, {"name": "CPHC News Items", "children": [{"name": ["Current news items for the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, Hawaii."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Summer Interns Return to IV&V", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: On Course for the Moon!", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: All Things Station", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments for Library of Congress Blogs", "children": [{"name": ["Blogs from the Library of Congress."]}]}, {"name": "Watch the Skies \u00bb Clementine", "children": [{"name": ["Just another NASA Blogs Sites site"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Chapman Conference Archives", "children": [{"name": ["Home"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Tennessee Department of Health announces Traumatic Brain Injury Conference set for March 17th", "children": [{"name": ["The voice of Clarksville Tennessee.

Title\n\nJulian/Gregorian? calendar name and constraints\n\n2. Moderator\n\n*\n\n3. Requirement\n\nAn accurate name for the mixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar system is needed as an alternative to the current naming scheme, which hides the complexity and pitfalls of this calendar.  Time range constraints enable error checking.\n\n4. Initial Statement of Technical Proposal\n\nA new calendar name \"Julian/Gregorian?\" is added to the existing CF synonyms for the mixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar as defined by UDUNITS.\n\n\nHowever, this is proposed as an independent calendar definition, because it is also desirable to add time range constraints which are not part of the original definitions.  Negative years, year zero, and illegal transition dates are all excluded.  I am excluding Julian negative years because there is no unambiguous definition in the broader context of general history.\n\n\nThis new definition is fully compatible with existing translation routines in UDUNITS and other calendar software, provided that any name checking procedures are updated.  Constraint checking is optional.\n\n\nThis proposal does not change existing usage or create incompatibility with existing data files.\n\n5. Benefits\nProvide an accurate and distinct alternate name for this calendar system, for those who wish to be more specific than the default or \"standard\".\nFacilitate migration away from inadequate calendar names, for both existing and new data sets.\nIncrease user awareness of complicated calendar usage and computational issues.\nThereby reduce undetected computational errors resulting from misunderstanding or misapplication of the mixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar.\nPreserve the mixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar definition within CF, for legitimate purposes.\nConstraint specifications support optional range checking to catch accidental misapplication and computational errors in time coordinates.\n6. Status Quo\n\nIf no alternative name is provided, the ongoing hidden usage of a complicated calendar will continue to engender misunderstanding, undetected errors, and controversy.\n\n7. Text of Proposed Changes\nIn \u200bsection 4.4.1, Calendar, insert a new definition as the second item in the list of calendars:\n\n\n\nJulian/Gregorian?\n\n\n\nMixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar, with constraints.  All usage of negative years, year zero, and transitional dates 1582 October 5 through 1582 October 14 inclusive, is prohibited.\n\n\n\n\nFor consistency, change the term \"Gregorian/Julian?\" to \"Julian/Gregorian?\" in three places in section 4.4.1.  Do not change the formal excerpt from the UDUNITS man page.\nAdd a new paragraph in 4.4.1, just above the third from last paragraph which now begins \"The mixed Julian/Gregorian? calendar used by Udunits is explained ...\":\n\n\n\nThe calendar name \"Julian/Gregorian?\" should be used only (a) in genuine historical data sets having a proper need to span the Julian/Gregorian? discontinuity; and (b) to facilitate backward compatibility in existing data sets.\n\n\n\n8.

It is intended to be extensible to constructs such as non-cell-based operators.\n\n\nA driver for creating CFSS strings is to enable the semantic mediation of fields passed between components during model run-time.  Standard names alone often cannot express the features of the data that are necessary for this sort of brokering.\n\n\nImportant features of CFSS are that it uses only CF-compliant content and is backward-compatible with existing standard names.\n\n\nCFSS strings are structured as follows:\n\n&lt;standard name of data 1&gt;, &lt;standard name of data 2&gt;, ... ,&lt;standard name of data n&gt;\n&lt;standard name of coordinate or cell method 1&gt;: &lt;value 1&gt; [&lt;unit 1&gt;]\n&lt;standard name of coordinate or cell method 2&gt;: &lt;value 2&gt; [&lt;unit 2&gt;] ...\n&lt;standard name of coordinate or cell method m&gt;: &lt;value m&gt; [&lt;unit m&gt;]\n\nwhere standard names of data are optional; qualifiers are optional; and units are included when they are required for a coordinate.  The ordering of standard names of data and the ordering of qualifiers does not affect equivalence of strings.\n\n\nExamples of compliant strings using CFSS are:\n\n\nx_wind\n\n\nx_wind height: 10 m\n\n\nx_wind height: 10 m time: mean region: atlantic_ocean\n\n\nx_wind, y_wind height: 10 m time: mean region: atlantic_ocean\n\n\nheight: 10 m time: mean region: atlantic_ocean\n\n\nThis proposal originated from discussions amongst Cecelia Deluca, Tim Campbell, Gerhard Theurich, Jonathan Gregory, Roy Lowry, Bryan Lawrence, and Balaji."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Geoff Green, Johnny Issaluk, WWF\u2019s Martin von Mirbach to Attend Conference", "children": [{"name": ["Youth collaboration to address environmental, economic & social challenges in the Arctic"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: OHA workshop at OAH, April 2014", "children": [{"name": ["Gathering & preserving historical information through recorded interviews"]}]}, {"name": "NASA's Visible Earth - Category\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0Agriculture\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0Agricultural Engineering", "children": [{"name": ["RSS data feed for NASA's Visible Earth Website"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Past Presidents", "children": [{"name": ["Gathering & preserving historical information through recorded interviews"]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Data Resources", "children": [{"name": ["Research at the NSF's funded facilities on the Greenland Interior Ice"]}]}, {"name": "UC Health \u00bb Translational medicine", "children": [{"name": ["University of California health news"]}]}, {"name": "Comments for Building Patriot Pride", "children": [{"name": ["Construction & Community News"]}]}, {"name": "Kepler News and Features", "children": [{"name": ["Kepler News and Features RSS"]}]}, {"name": "Crime", "children": []}, {"name": "CF Metadata: Ticket #97: Multiple staggers in GRIDSPEC", "children": [{"name": ["Currently the \u200bCF GRIDSPEC convention only represents the grid information for a single stagger location.

This has the benefit of reducing the amount of redundant information and also producing a clearer representation of the structure of the data. There are two proposed methods to allow the multiple staggers.\n\n\nThe first method is to increase the resolution of a GRIDSPEC tile to allow it hold the information for all staggers at once. This \"supergrid\" method was proposed in the original GRIDSPEC document. For an in-depth description of our implementation of this method see here:\n\u200bhttp://earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf/gridspec_stagger_supergrid.\n\n\nThe second method is allow a GRIDSPEC tile file to contain multiple versions of each tile each with a possibly different size. Each of these tile versions would contain the information for a separate stagger. For an in-depth description of this method see here:\n\u200bhttp://earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf/cf_stagger\n\n\nIn addition to the usual refinement of a proposal by community comment, part of the aim of this ticket is to narrow these two proposals down to one, any comments in this regard are also welcome."]}]}, {"name": "Comments on: Middle Tennessee Hiring Fair for Veterans this Week", "children": [{"name": ["The voice of Clarksville Tennessee.

In Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth, Jim Steenburgh investigates Wasatch weather, exposing the myths, explaining the reality, and revealing how and why Utah's powder lives up to its reputation. Steenburgh also examines ski and snowboard regions beyond Utah, making this book a meteorological guide to mountain weather and snow climates around the world.   Chapters explore mountain weather, avalanches and snow safety, historical accounts of weather events and snow conditions, and the basics of climate and weather forecasting. Steenburgh explains what creates the best snow for skiing and snowboarding in accurate and accessible language and illustrates his points with 150 color photographs, making Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth a helpful tool for planning vacations and staying safe during mountain adventures. Snowriders, weather enthusiasts, meteorologists, students of snow science, and anyone who dreams of deep powder and bluebird skies will want to get their gloves on Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth.

If you write code that checks if it already has the lock and doesn't attempt to acquire it again, you avoid the deadlock but could release the lock prematurely. In SQL, we have the same problem. If your code is already in a transaction, starting a new transaction has the surprising and unfortunate consequence of committing the current transaction and starting a new one. Java solves the nesting problem with its locks by implementing support for a nesting structure similar to what we test below. Java allows you to mark functions as \"synchronized,\" which causes the function to wait for lock acquisition before running and release the lock when no longer needed. If one synchronized function calls another in the same class, Java track the lock nesting. The outer function acquires the lock, the inner function performs no locking operations, and the outer function releases the lock when it returns."]}]}, {"name": "Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Legacy View", "children": []}, {"name": "NSIDC Photo & Image Gallery - Most viewed/NSIDC GDC OpenHouse i", "children": []}, {"name": "University Information - George Mason University", "children": []}, {"name": "Office of Governor Edmund G.

Across these sections the authors address the relevance of archaeology in the modern world; new approaches and concerns about collaboration across disciplines, communities, and subgroups; and the importance of multiple perspectives.Particular attention is paid to the various ways that archaeology can and should contribute to contemporary social and environmental issues. Contributors come together to provide a synthetic volume on current research and possibilities for future explorations. Moving forward, they argue that archaeologists must continue to include researchers from across political and disciplinary boundaries and enhance collaboration with Native American groups.This book will be of interest to professional and academic archaeologists, as well as students working in the field of the American Southwest.

The Archaeology of Regional Interaction investigates these questions, using the rich resource of the American Southwest and covering periods from the Folsom to the nineteenth century. Editor Michelle Hegmon has compiled superbly researched essays into a comprehensive examination of regional interaction that has proved itself a pivotal archaeological text.The Archaeology of Regional Interaction surpasses most regional studies, which only focus on settlement patterns or exchange, and considers other forms of interaction, such as intermarriage and the spread of religious practices. Contributors focus especially on understanding the social processes that underlie archaeological evidence of interaction.The essays in this volume examine what regional systems involve, in terms of political and economic relations, and how they can be identified. One essay by Steven LeBlanc provides a sweeping analysis of conflict, a form of regional interaction that has received relatively little attention in the Southwest until recently. A series of chapters devoted to expanding the coverage beyond the borders of the traditional Southwest examines the surrounding areas, including Nevada and Utah, northern Mexico, and the Plains.The volume also provides a unique treatment of religion - including manifestations such as Flower World Iconography, Medicine Societies, and ceremonial textiles - as a form of regional interrelation.

These pledges bring us an important step closer to achieving the President\u2019s ConnectED goal to get ultra-fast Internet connections and educational technology into K-12 classrooms nationwide. NTIA has already enabled major advances in connecting schools to broadband and building the foundation for digital learning both in the classroom and beyond. Through our Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), NTIA invested in roughly 230 projects nationwide to expand access to and use of broadband.

As his punishment, Artemis banished the hunter to the sky where he can be seen as the famous constellation Orion. In the constellation, Orion's head is represented by the star Lamdba Orionis (fuzzy red dot in middle). When viewed in infrared light, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, shows a giant nebula around Lambda Orionis, inflating Orion's head to huge proportions.  Lambda Orionis is a hot, massive star that is surrounded by several other hot, massive stars, all of which are creating radiation that excites a ring of dust, creating the \"Lambda Orionis molecular ring.\" Also known as SH 2-264, the Lambda Orionis molecular ring is sometimes called the Meissa ring. In Arabic, the star Lambda Orionis is known as \"Meissa\" or \"Al-Maisan,\" meaning \"the shining one.\" The Meissa Ring is of interest to astronomers because it contains clusters of young stars and proto-stars, or forming stars, embedded within the clouds. With a diameter of approximately 130 light-years, the Lambda Orionis molecular ring is notable for being one of the largest star-forming regions WISE has seen. This is also the largest single image featured by WISE so far, with an area of the sky approximately 10 by 10 degrees in size, equivalent to a grid of 20 by 20 full moons. Nevertheless, at less than one percent of the whole sky's area, it is just a taste of WISE data.  The bright blue star in the lower left corner of the image is the star Betelgeuse, which represents one shoulder of the hunter Orion. The name Betelgeuse is actually a corruption of the original Arabic phrase \"Yad al-Jauza',\" meaning \"hand of the giant one.\" Betelgeuse is well known for being a red supergiant star, yet in WISE's infrared view it appears blue, as do most stars in WISE images. This is because most stars, including Betelgeuse, put out more light in the shortest infrared wavelengths of light captured by WISE, and those shorter wavelengths are presented in WISE images as blue and cyan.  In visible light, Orion's other shoulder is clearly marked by the variable star Bellatrix. In infrared light, however, Bellatrix is a somewhat unremarkable cyan-colored star in the right side of the image. In Latin, Bellatrix means \"female warrior,\" which is perhaps why the name was chosen for a female witch character in the popular Harry Potter books.  Also seen in this image are two dark nebulae, Barnard 30 and Barnard 35, which are parts of the Meissa ring that are so dense they block out visible light. Barnard 30 is the bright knob of gas and dust in the top center part of the image. Barnard 35 appears as a hook extending towards the center of the ring just above and to the right of the star Betelgeuse. The bright reddish object seen to in the middle right part of the image is the star HR 1763, which is surrounded by another star-forming region, LBN 867.  Color in this image represents specific wavelengths of infrared light. Blue and cyan represent 3.4- and 4.6-microns, primarily light emitted by hot stars. Green and red represent 12- and 22-micron light, which is mainly radiation from warm dust.

Vascular plant species were recorded in 104.1 m2 plots on the island of \u00d6land (Sweden) and the functional properties of the plant species recorded in the plots were characterized in terms of the ground-cover of grasses, specific leaf area and Ellenberg indicator values. Plots were assigned to three different grassland age-classes,  representing 5\u201315, 16\u201350 and &gt;50 years of grazing management. Partial least squares discriminant analysis models were used to compare classifications based on aerial hyperspectral data with the age-class classification. The remote sensing data successfully classified the plots into age-classes: the overall classification accuracy was higher for  a model based on a pre-selected set of wavebands (85%, Kappa statistic value = 0.77) than one using the full set of wavebands (77%, Kappa statistic value = 0.65). Our results show that nutrient availability and grass cover differences between grassland age-classes are detectable by spectral imaging.

It demonstrates\u2014with many examples and illustrations\u2014how to apply the theory to explain observations and to make quantitative calculations and predictions. In this book, Sven Erik J\u00f8rgensen takes a first step toward integrating thermodynamics, biochemistry, hierarchical organization, and network theory into a holistic theory of systems ecology. The first part of the book covers the laws of thermodynamics and the basic biochemistry of living organisms, as well as the constraints they impose on ecosystems. To grow and develop, however, ecosystems have to evade these thermodynamic and biochemical constraints, so the second part of the book discusses the seven basic properties that enable ecosystems to grow, develop, and survive:  They are open systems, far from thermodynamic equilibrium. They are organized hierarchically. They have a high diversity. They have high buffer capacities toward changes. Their components are organized in cooperative networks, which allows for sophisticated feedback, regulation mechanisms, and higher efficiencies. They contain an enormous amount of information embodied in genomes. They have emerging system properties. This timely textbook also looks at how systems ecology is applied in integrated environmental management, particularly in ecological modeling and engineering and in the assessment of ecosystem health using ecological indicators. Acknowledging that there is still much room for improvement, it will inspire ecologists to develop a stronger and more widely applicable ecosystem theory."]}]}, {"name": "June | 2014 | ISS On-Orbit Status Report | Page 11", "children": []}, {"name": "Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)", "children": []}, {"name": "ARIANNA housekeeping and event data from prototype station", "children": []}, {"name": "Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)", "children": []}, {"name": "Luke Plunkett - Shit Luke Plunkett Says", "children": [{"name": ["Shit Luke Plunkett Says"]}]}, {"name": "AIRS Nighttime H2O 500mb Satellite Imagery: dataset description", "children": []}, {"name": "Global Change Master Directory - Variable Definition Page", "children": []}, {"name": "OWLeS - Ontario Winter Lake effect Systems", "children": []}, {"name": "NASA - \nContact the Committee by E-Mail or Postal Mail", "children": [{"name": ["NASA.gov brings you images, videos and interactive features from the unique perspective of America\u2019s space agency.
